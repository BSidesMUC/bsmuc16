		<p>BSidesMUC is still in it's early stage, so there isn't much to see yet. Once it rolls, it will be a free infosec conference held in Munich. BSides are hosted all over the world and are community driven conferences, that are usually free to attend. This also means that the conference will be what every attendee makes of it. So if you go there why not give a talk, create a workshop, design a challenge for other attendees, help with the CTF, organization or sponsoring.</p>
