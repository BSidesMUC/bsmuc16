Once it rolls, it will be a free to attend infosec conference held in beautiful Munich. BSides are hosted all over the world and are community driven conferences, that are usually free to attend. That also means that the conference will be, what every attendee makes of it. So if you go there, why not give a talk, create a workshop, design a challenge for other attendees, help with the CTF or with organization or sponsoring.\r\n\r\n![logo.png](/images/logo.png)\r\n\r\n### Want to help?\r\nIf you want to help, just contact us.
